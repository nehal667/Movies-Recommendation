Developed a movie recommendation system that leverages a dataset of 5,000 movies to suggest similar titles based on user preferences. The system employs content-based filtering to compute similarity scores between movies, allowing it to recommend the top 5 movies most closely related to the user's selected title. The recommendation process involves analyzing various movie attributes such as genre, plot, and cast, which are used to determine the similarity between films. By selecting a movie from the dataset, users receive a curated list of five recommended movies, each accompanied by its title and poster image fetched dynamically using The Movie Database API. This system provides a personalized viewing experience by efficiently narrowing down options based on individual movie selections.
